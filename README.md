This application was created as part of my capstone project for devCodeCamp. This application features a landing page displaying all of the business services, homegoods, ect. This application also has a unique feature of a business owner dashboard. Allowing the business owner to login, and update some of the features of the web application. I am actively making adjustments and testing out new features.

Technologies: React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Django, Django REST Framework, MySQL, Axios, and Postman
